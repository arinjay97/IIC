# SETTING UP DOCKER ON UBUNTU

The easiest way to create a Docker image is to create a Dockerfile for the same. Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using `docker build` users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

For more information about the different types of commands that a Dockerfile supports, [a handy cheat sheet](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Dockerfile.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) can be referred to.
